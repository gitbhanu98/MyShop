Here we are Injecting our classes as parameters to the Constructor and This should be handled using DependencyInjection (DI) container.
We use the DI container to inject our concrete classes in place of interfaces. There are lot of DI containers to do this but we have used Microsoft Unity here.
We have installed a Nuget Package Manager of Unity.MVC and Unity.Container on Myshop.WebUI project.
These DI concept is implemented in both ProductManagerController and ProductCategoryMangerController.

After installing the nuget packages, go to App start folder in WebUI project. Open the UnityCOnfig.cs file.
Register our classes to the container as below:
container.RegisterType<IRepository<Product>, InMemoryRepository<Product>>();
container.RegisterType<IRepository<ProductCategory>, InMemoryRepository<ProductCategory>>();
